# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest and Deep Neural Network (5 layers) on a real anonymized dataset.
Used undersampling and oversampling (SMOTE) with Deep Neural Network to balance the highly imbalanced dataset (very less fraudulent transactions as compared to non-fraudulent ones).
Achieved 99.6% test accuracy using SMOTE with NN along with 0 Type-II errors (false negatives).
